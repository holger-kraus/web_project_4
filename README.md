## Web Development course at Yandex Practicum
I am participating in an excellent web development course at [Yandex Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.com/) right now.
You get a very good introduction into many web development topics on their learning platform. After mastering the
according lessons, you have to proof your newly acquired skills in your own projects.

## My third project
This is my third project that I have implemented as part of the course. This time we started using javascript in order to
add some functionality to the website. Luckily we just had to optimize the layout for two different screen sizes and not
for six like in the assigment before. It was the first time we used HTML, CSS and Javascript together in a project.

### Functionality

The web site is a profile page. It contains a set of photographies that can be liked by users. The page also contains
an edit functionality where the user can change the name and the about me information. The edit form pops up in a modal
dialogue. Furthermore the user can add further images by providing their URIs. He also can remove images again from the
photo grid. If he clicks on one of the the photo cards, the photo enlarges and is displayed as the main element on the
screen.

### Technologies

* Semantic HTML like
